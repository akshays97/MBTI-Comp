This is starter code for our Kaggle competition. The goal is to be able to predict a Meyers Briggs personality characteristic from text that someone with that personality type had. We have decided to predict Thinking or Feeling. 

```Myers Briggs Classification - Full.ipynb	``` contains a basic featurization algorithm and goes on to use a logistic regression, random forrest, and TensorFlow to predict. 

```Myers Briggs Classification - Abridged.ipynb	``` starts begins with already featurized data and goes straight into machine learning models. This is the easiest place to star. 

Both notebooks are annotated in places where we believe improvements can be made.

If you want to participate you can use none, any or all of this code, the overall goal is to improve upon the accuracy of the predictions however you can.
